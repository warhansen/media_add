# media_add
A Python Flask project. The idea of this project is to create a single, simple interface that will allow people to add movies or series to a media server
by connecting to the api of Sonarr and Radarr and thus removing all the complicated settings the admin users sees and allows the 
adding of movies or series for basic users.
